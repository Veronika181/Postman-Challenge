ðŸš€ 30 Days of Postman Challenge ðŸš€
I recently started the 30 Days of Postman challenge, which helps me improve my API testing skills. Each day, I tackle new tasks that include:

Forking the collection into my workspace.
Exploring instructions and additional resources.
Validating my solutions.
During this challenge, I will learn:

The basics and advanced features of Postman.
Effective API testing and how to create test suites.
Using variables and scripts for test automation.
This challenge is deepening my knowledge of APIs and testing methodologies. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their Postman skills!
